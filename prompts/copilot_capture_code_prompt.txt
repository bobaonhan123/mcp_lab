Capture code blocks from source files and generate documentation through the MCP server.

Instructions:
1. Identify the source file and line ranges you want to capture.
2. Use the MCP tool `capture_code_block` to extract code with line numbers.
3. The tool will return the code block with file path, line numbers, and formatted content.
4. You can capture multiple blocks from the same file or different files.

Available tools:
- `capture_code_block` - Capture a single code block from a file with line numbers
  Parameters: file_path (required), start_line (required), end_line (optional, defaults to start_line)
  
- `capture_multiple_blocks` - Capture multiple code blocks from the same file
  Parameters: file_path (required), ranges (required - list of [start, end] pairs)

Example usage:
- Capture lines 10-20 from src/app/main.py: 
  `capture_code_block(file_path="src/app/main.py", start_line=10, end_line=20)`

- Capture multiple blocks from the same file:
  `capture_multiple_blocks(file_path="src/helpers/utils.py", ranges=[[1, 15], [30, 45], [60, 75]])`

After capturing code blocks, you can:
- Document the code by describing what each block does
- Create code examples or tutorials
- Generate API documentation
- Extract specific functions or classes for review

The tool automatically:
- Detects programming language from file extension
- Formats code with line numbers
- Preserves indentation and syntax
- Provides markdown-formatted output

After capturing and describing the code, confirm which blocks were captured and explain their purpose.
