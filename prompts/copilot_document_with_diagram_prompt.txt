Document code with sequence diagram and save to Excel through the MCP server.

This prompt creates an Excel file with 2 sheets:
- Sheet 1 "Code Blocks": Captured code with line numbers
- Sheet 2 "Sequence Diagram": PlantUML code and rendered diagram image

Instructions:
1. Specify the source file you want to document
2. The AI will analyze the code and identify important sections
3. A sequence diagram will be created showing the code flow
4. Everything is saved to a single Excel file

Example usage:
"Document the code in src/helpers/code.py and create a sequence diagram showing how code capture works"

The tool will:
1. Identify key functions (e.g., capture_code_block, format_code_block)
2. Capture those functions with their line numbers
3. Create a PlantUML sequence diagram like:

@startuml
participant Client
participant "capture_code_block" as Capture
participant "Path" as Path
participant "File" as File

Client -> Capture: capture_code_block(file_path, start, end)
Capture -> Path: Create Path object
Capture -> Path: Check exists()
Path --> Capture: True/False
Capture -> File: open() and readlines()
File --> Capture: lines[]
Capture -> Capture: Extract lines[start:end]
Capture --> Client: CodeBlock(path, start, end, code)

4. Save to Excel with both code blocks and the diagram

After the tool call, confirm:
- Which code sections were captured (with line numbers)
- What the sequence diagram shows
- The output file path
